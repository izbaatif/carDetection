    "        <h1 align='center'> Motion Detection </h1>\n",
    "        <p> For this task, I just need opencv library so I first download it and then import it. I decided to detect motion by using the background subtraction and frame differencing method. The first frame was the base frame. Then the program checked if the frame was empty and if it was it will break the loop. This is for releasing the video when it ends. Since opencv uses brg instead of the basic rgb, I converted the frames to grey and then the first frame is assigned if its not done already. After this the difference between the first and current frame is calculated and the threshold function is used to get the difference. Using that the contours are found and drawn. Lastly, the webcam video is shown with the contours on it. Small contours are ignored so I set this value high to ignore people and cars that aren't on the main street.</p>\n",
